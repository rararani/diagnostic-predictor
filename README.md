# diagnostic-predictor
As our final project for CSC311: Introduction to Machine Learning at UofT, we experimented with recommender systems. In this repo you'll find we have implemented several algorithms for a recommender system that predicts if a student would be able to answer questions correctly.

We have implemented, user-based KNN, itemized KNN, an IRT model, and a model using alternating least squares with stochastic gradient descent. In Part B of the project, we have decided to extend our IRT model to attempt at improving its accuracy.

`final_report.pdf` contains our full analysis and calculations regarding each model/algorithm in further depth.
